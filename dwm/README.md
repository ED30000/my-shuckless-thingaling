Do you want to see my suckless thinaling?

Might require doas and fudo, i forgot if i put it in any script.
Also make sure ether your user or atleast for some of the scripts in .local/bin to have root privelages whit out having to input passord for them to work.
Also also some scripts might want runnit.
Also also also i recomend adding .local/bin to $PATH to make using the script more conveniant.
